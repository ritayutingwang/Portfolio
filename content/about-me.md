Hi, I am Rita. I am a full-stack product designer, now looking for next opportunity to make impact on things I am passionate about. I pride myself as a product person that brings critical thinking and design skills to the table, to deliver value to people with technology.

I enjoy the process and impact of solving people problems and business problems. I enjoy building great products that deliver value to people, especially if they provide access to things people didn't have otherwise.

I previously worked with Carousell, the largest second-hand marketplace in South East Asia, where I designed to inspire everyone in the world to start selling, and to facilitate the transactions between two sides smoothly. Being the second designer hired into the team, I contributed to growth, engagement, monetization, and core tech, and evolve design system to reach consistency, efficiency, and scalability.

Besides the work that delivers value to users directly, I took on initiatives during my time at Carousell that scales our effort as product team:

- I helped scale the product design team by contributing in hiring and mentoring junior designers.
- I led the user research process and training before we hired first researcher, helped shape the design process, and was one of the main contributors for design systems, specialised in using technology and tools to keep our components simple and usable in diverse use cases.
- I led teams wining 3 internal hackathons. I am good at pitching ideas to recruit people to join my team and structure a plan to get things done. I co-hosted one internal hackathon, bringing team members outside of tech on board with problem solving and exercise their get it done spirit. I co-hosted the short version of hackathon as part of Carousell's monthly onboarding program for new hires.

In January 2020, before the global pandemic happens, I moved out of Singapore and took a break to enjoy quality time with family and friends, food, and nature back in Taiwan.

I continue selling on Carousell and had 200+ transactions during pandemic to stay in touch with people (online), hone my pitching and communication skill, and live a less-is-more lifestyle with more liquid asset in pocket.

I read daily, mainly non-fiction books related to life, career, and problem solving / design.

I studied computer science and management in college. I enjoy solving programming / mathematical problems on LeetCode.
